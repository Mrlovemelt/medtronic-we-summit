# Medtronic WE Summit Interactive Installation Brief

## Project Overview

An interactive data visualization installation titled "The We Are Wall - A living snapshot of us" for the Medtronic WE Summit (July 8-9, 2025) that collects demographic and personal information from attendees via mobile survey and displays connections in a visually compelling way on an LED wall. The visualization will also be featured during key moments in the main ballroom presentations.

## Data Visualization Concepts

To emphasize "We are different, but we are also similar":

1. **Connected Constellations**
    - Individual nodes represent each attendee
    - Lines connect people with similar responses in specific categories
    - Clusters form naturally around common responses
    - Color-coding by years at Medtronic (Q1)
    - Visualization can be rotated to highlight different dimensions
2. **Woven Tapestry**
    - Each response creates a thread in a larger fabric
    - Individual threads show unique paths, but together create a cohesive pattern
    - Thread thickness increases when multiple identical responses exist
    - Different views can emphasize either individual stories or collective patterns
3. **Dynamic Network**
    - Interactive web of connections that shifts based on which question is being highlighted
    - Animations show how the same group reconfigures when viewing different dimensions
    - Emphasizes that we group differently based on which aspect of identity is in focus
4. **Flowing Rivers**
    - Sankey diagram-inspired visualization where participants flow through different response categories
    - Shows how people with one commonality (e.g., similar motivation) might diverge in learning styles
    - Visually demonstrates both individual journeys and common pathways
